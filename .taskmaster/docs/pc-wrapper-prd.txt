# PC Wrapper - NSFW AI Generation Platform PRD

## Project Overview
PC Wrapper is a full-stack SaaS platform built on top of the Promptchan API, enabling NSFW AI-powered image, video, and chat generation through a seamless user interface. The platform abstracts all complexity from the underlying Promptchan API ‚Äî users never interact with Promptchan directly. Instead, PC Wrapper provides a secure, branded, and highly efficient layer that delivers adult AI generation as a product.
