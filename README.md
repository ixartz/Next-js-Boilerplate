### Requirements

- Node.js 20+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/justinbachtell/Smartvest-Bot.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

For your information, all dependencies are updated every month.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Set up authentication

To get started, you will need to create a Clerk account at [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and create a new application in the Clerk Dashboard. Once you have done that, copy the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` values and add them to the `.env.local` file (not tracked by Git):

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_pub_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

Now you have a fully functional authentication system with Next.js, including features such as sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, reset password, update profile, update password, update email, delete account, and more.

### Set up remote database

The project uses DrizzleORM, a type-safe ORM that is compatible with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL databases. By default, the project is configured to work with Supabase.

### Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses `next-intl` combined with [Crowdin](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js). As a developer, you only need to take care of the English (or another default language) version. Translations for other languages are automatically generated and handled by Crowdin. You can use Crowdin to collaborate with your translation team or translate the messages yourself with the help of machine translation.

To set up translation (i18n), create an account at [Crowdin.com](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js) and create a new project. In the newly created project, you will be able to find the project ID. You will also need to create a new Personal Access Token by going to Account Settings > API. Then, in your GitHub Actions, you need to define the following environment variables: `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.

After defining the environment variables in your GitHub Actions, your localization files will be synchronized with Crowdin every time you push a new commit to the `main` branch.

```

### Change database schema

To modify the database schema in the project, you can update the schema file located at `./src/models/Schema.ts`. This file defines the structure of your database tables using the Drizzle ORM library.

After making changes to the schema, generate a migration by running the following command:

```shell
npm run db:generate
```

This will create a migration file that reflects your schema changes. The migration is automatically applied during the next database interaction, so there is no need to run it manually or restart the Next.js server.

### Commit Message Format

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, meaning all commit messages must be formatted accordingly. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is the ability to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Testing

All unit tests are located alongside the source code in the same directory, making them easier to find. The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with the following command:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing. You can run the tests with the following commands:

```shell
npx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
npm run test:e2e
```

In the local environment, visual testing is disabled, and the terminal will display the message `[percy] Percy is not running, disabling snapshots.`. By default, visual testing only runs in GitHub Actions.

### Enable Edge runtime (optional)

The App Router folder is compatible with the Edge runtime. You can enable it by adding the following lines `src/app/layouts.tsx`:

```tsx
export const runtime = 'edge';
```

For your information, the database migration is not compatible with the Edge runtime. So, you need to disable the automatic migration in `src/libs/DB.ts`:

```tsx
await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: './migrations' });
```

After disabling it, you are required to run the migration manually with:

```shell
npm run db:migrate
```

You also require to run the command each time you want to update the database schema.

### Deploy to production

During the build process, database migrations are automatically executed, so there's no need to run them manually. However, you must define `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables.

Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the repository. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

You also need to defined the environment variables `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` using your own key.

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.

### Error Monitoring

The project uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/nextjs/) to monitor errors. In the development environment, no additional setup is needed: the app is pre-configured to use Sentry and Spotlight (Sentry for Development). All errors will automatically be sent to your local Spotlight instance, allowing you to experience Sentry locally.

For production environment, you'll need to create a Sentry account and a new project. Then, in `next.config.mjs`, you need to update the `org` and `project` attributes in `withSentryConfig` function. Additionally, add your Sentry DSN to `sentry.client.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts` and `sentry.server.config.ts`.

### Code coverage

The Smartvest Bot relies on [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/codecov-free-trial) for code coverage reporting solution. To enable Codecov, create a Codecov account and connect it to your GitHub account. Your repositories should appear on your Codecov dashboard. Select the desired repository and copy the token. In GitHub Actions, define the `CODECOV_TOKEN` environment variable and paste the token.

Make sure to create `CODECOV_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret, do not paste it directly into your source code.

### Logging

The project uses Pino.js for logging. In the development environment, logs are displayed in the console by default.

For production, the project is already integrated with [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com) to manage and query your logs using SQL. To use Better Stack, you need to create a [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com) account and create a new source: go to your Better Stack Logs Dashboard > Sources > Connect source. Then, you need to give a name to your source and select Node.js as the platform.

After creating the source, you will be able to view and copy your source token. In your environment variables, paste the token into the `LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN` variable. Now, all logs will automatically be sent to and ingested by Better Stack.

### Checkly monitoring

The project uses [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com) to ensure that your production environment is always up and running. At regular intervals, Checkly runs the tests ending with `*.check.e2e.ts` extension and notifies you if any of the tests fail. Additionally, you have the flexibility to execute tests from multiple locations to ensure that your application is available worldwide.

To use Checkly, you must first create an account on [their website](https://www.checklyhq.com). After creating an account, generate a new API key in the Checkly Dashboard and set the `CHECKLY_API_KEY` environment variable in GitHub Actions. Additionally, you will need to define the `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`, which can also be found in your Checkly Dashboard under User Settings > General.

To complete the setup, update the `checkly.config.ts` file with your own email address and production URL.

### Arcjet security and bot protection

The project uses [Arcjet](https://launch.arcjet.com/Q6eLbRE), a security as code product that includes several features that can be used individually or combined to provide defense in depth for your site.

To set up Arcjet, [create a free account](https://launch.arcjet.com/Q6eLbRE) and get your API key. Then add it to the `ARCJET_KEY` environment variable.

Arcjet is configured with two main features: bot detection and the Arcjet Shield WAF:

- [Bot detection](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/concepts) is configured to allow search engines, preview link generators e.g. Slack and Twitter previews, and to allow common uptime monitoring services. All other bots, such as scrapers and AI crawlers, will be blocked. You can [configure additional bot types](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/identifying-bots) to allow or block.
- [Arcjet Shield WAF](https://docs.arcjet.com/shield/concepts) will detect and block common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

Arcjet is configured with a central client at `src/libs/Arcjet.ts` that includes the Shield WAF rules. Additional rules are configured in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` based on the page type.

### Useful commands

#### Bundle Analyzer

The Smartvest Bot app includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.

#### Database Studio

The project is already configured with Drizzle Studio to explore the database. You can run the following command to open the database studio:

```shell
npm run db:studio
```

Then, you can open https://local.drizzle.studio with your favorite browser to explore your database.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode user, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed in your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and display errors. The same applies to testing: you can install the VSCode Vitest extension to automatically run your tests, and it also shows the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide-type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
